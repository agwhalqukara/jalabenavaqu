The Fever rushed down the court, and Clark found Kristy Wallace for a layup attempt. The ball did not go in, but the ball went out-of-bounds on Chicago. Boston had another long shot attempt for the win but did not get it.</p><p>The Sky then let the door open again after Kamilla Cardoso missed two free throws, giving Indiana a chance at a tip-in attempt after a timeout and with less than three-tenths of a second left.
