In the social media posts, Pharrell appears in a photo holding the line‚Äôs first three products, under the caption ‚ÄúProud dad moment.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Proud dad moment üíö <a href=#>@humanrace</a> skincare routine dropping November 25<a href=#>https://t.co/GuGc0b8SWT</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/r6E7IZ9Qqm</a></p>‚Äî Pharrell Williams (@Pharrell) <a href=#>November 11, 2020</a></figure><p>In a new interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Allure</a>, the musician shared his holistic skin-care philosophy, a mantra he is hoping will resonate with others.</p><p>‚ÄúSometimes you need to cleanse your spirit. Sometimes you just need to cleanse your mind. Sometimes you‚Äôve just got to get rid of some dead skin,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúSometimes you‚Äôve got to get rid of some bad habits. Sometimes you just need to be humidified, brought to life. Sometimes your spirit needs that.‚Äù</p><p>According to Allure, Williams attributed his boyish visage to an attentiveness to skin care he has stayed true to since his early 20s. He shared that earlier in his career, he‚Äôd ask models about the types of products they would use. He ultimately connected with Jones, who personally treats him as a dermatologist and acted as a consultant on the skin-care line.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/p1-600x338.jpg><p>Jones is a board-certified dermatologist, currently practicing in New York City. She has gone on to become one of the few Black board-certified <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>dermatologists</a> in the city. In her 20 years of private practice, Jones has imparted her medical knowledge in ‚Äúlectures, medical journal publications, legal case reviews, magazines, radio and television interviews,‚Äù according to her <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>website</a>.</p><p>Of Williams and his skin-care focus, Jones told Allure, ‚ÄúWhat struck me most about my first meeting with him was how committed to his skin and health he was at his age. He wanted a routine to follow, and he‚Äôs dedicated to a skin-care regimen. He wanted explanations for everything,‚Äù Jones said.</p><p>Some of the Humanrace products include Rice Powder Cleanser, Lotus Enzyme Exfoliator and Humidifying Cream.</p><p>Fifty percent of the plastic used to contain Humanrace‚Äôs products comes from ‚Äúpost-consumer recycled plastic,‚Äù with only a little amount of ‚Äúvirgin plastic‚Äù utilized. Every product also has a removable inner compartment that can be replaced for a refill. The cap is imprinted with a raised logo and is reflected with the brand‚Äôs name in braille.</p><p>Allure had an objective cosmetic chemist review the entire ingredients list for each product, with that chemist concluding, ‚ÄúThey are formulated beautifully.‚Äù</p><p>The Humanrace skin-care line is scheduled to launch on Nov. 25 with an accompanying website of the same name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe5BqZmprX6W1or7EpaNmmZ6jvLa6wp6qZqubnrtur8CrnGakmaOybrTUppinm5Gnsm7DyK2fZpqclrCsecOeqaaZpKS5sLPIrKtmnKJisq2xzZpko6eemsBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
