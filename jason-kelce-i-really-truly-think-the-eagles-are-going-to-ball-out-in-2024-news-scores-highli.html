Brown and DeVonta Smith. They also seemed like they could be on their way to another Super Bowl last season when they started 10-1.</p><p>However, it all fell apart from there as they lost five of their final six regular-season games and were eliminated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC Wild Card Round.</p><p>Part of bouncing back and playing at the level Kelce expects in 2024 will be figuring out a way to replace his production as a dominant force at center.</p><p>He was a seven-time Pro Bowler and six-time First-Team All-Pro selection during his 13 seasons with the Eagles and was a major reason they were able to do things such as the tush push play on short-yardage situations.</p><p>He will certainly be missed along the offensive front, but he still believes Philadelphia will be a playoff team without him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWaGc4WMo5isp55iuKa4wp5komWimq6tuNhmq6utnK56tbTIp6JmrJiaeqatxqWcrGWRp7Jus86ipaBlpKR6o63LpWSoraRitq95kWlpbQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
