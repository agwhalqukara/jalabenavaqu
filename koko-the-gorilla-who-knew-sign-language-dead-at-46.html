Koko whimpered upon hearing the news and video footage showed her signing the words for cat, cry, sorry, and Koko-love after Patterson asked, “What happened to Ball?”</p><p>Celebrity encounters included a 2001 video with Robin Williams, in which Koko is seen trying on the comedian’s glasses and goofing around with him:</p><p>In 2016, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers <a href=# rel=noopener>gave Koko his bass</a> to play – not a terrible challenge for the animal, who learned to play the recorder in 2012.</p><p>The Gorilla Foundation, established by Patterson in 1976, said it will be honoring Koko’s long legacy with a sign language app featuring the famed animal.</p><p>“Koko touched the lives of millions as an ambassador for all gorillas and an icon for interspecies communication and empathy,” the foundation said in a press release, adding, “She was beloved and will be deeply missed.”</p><p>Next read experts’ opinions on the death of <a href=#>Harambe the Gorilla</a>.
