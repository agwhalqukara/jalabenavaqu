As it was previously reported, Jana and Mike called off their marriage of one year after Jana found out Mike cheated on her with another woman.</p><p>However, about a year and a half later, Mike and Jana renewed their vows on a beach in Hawaii. Caussin said on the podcast that he has been in a 12-step sex addiction program. Mike isn’t the only person to struggle with an illness as specific as this one.</p><p>One star to recently open up about his problems with sex was the singer-songwriter, Justin Bieber. In an interview, Justin admitted he had a “real problem with sex” and his turn toward religious faith and the church helped him deal with personal demons.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvrQ0YAgkt7/</p><p>Rumor has it that Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber even abstained from sex to prove they really are in love with each other, rather than in lust. Justin and Hailey are both quite religious, especially Hailey, who comes from a religious family.</p><p>Getting back to Kramer, the star shared a statement on her social media in which she praised her husband for sharing his “story and his truth” regarding addiction.</p><p>The 35-year-old said she “couldn’t wait to see all the people” Mike would help while on his journey. Interestingly, some fans on social media suggested an illness like “sex addiction,” is more of a disease of the rich and famous, rather than ordinary individuals.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Nonetheless, later on in the podcast, Caussin said he and Jana have been through a lot of problems. However, Mike explained, owning the fact he has a sex addiction is a step in the right direction.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGealruiecqrmKadomK%2FpsLEmqOsZaOdsrR50qhkqaqfqrFuu8VmpKKjlWKwosHSrKCnZZakv26tw6agrayZo7RutMisZJqclJ6wtbXOp6pmamZpfnaAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
