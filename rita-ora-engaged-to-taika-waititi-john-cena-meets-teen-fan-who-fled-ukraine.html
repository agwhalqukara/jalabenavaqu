Now, his dreams of meeting Cena have come true, as the sports legend and Peacemaker actor was left inspired by his story.</p><p>Cena said: “Having three days off from work right at the time I read the story, and being an hour away [from the Netherlands] by air, it turned into ‘We’re going.’ And that means spending an afternoon building blocks, eating cake – that’s a special afternoon when it comes to new friends I was able to meet.”</p><h3>Johnny Depp’s lawyer Camille Vasquez gets promotion</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>We are pleased to announce that Camille Vasquez has been elevated to partner.
