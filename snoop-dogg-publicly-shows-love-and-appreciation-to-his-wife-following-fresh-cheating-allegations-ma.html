This comes right after the infamous Celina Powel came back online with cheating accusations involving the rapper.</p><p>She claimed a while ago that he cheated on his wife with her, and this was a massive scandal back then.</p><p>‘@bosslady_ent. Thanks4 the . Kids loyalty stability n the ability to deal with me on my worst days 🥰 u are appreciated 💝💙💯’ Snoop captioned his post.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_yGaYkBJZj/</p><p>Someone said: ‘I remember when Tupac told you to marry her 👏🏾 she is so beautiful,’ and another follower posted this message: ‘Idk why my black uncles stay embarrassing their black queens. It’s time to retire the magnums and stay faithful to your queens.’</p><p>One other follower said: ‘Unc has been posting his wife and kids since that stray bullet that he caught yesterday,’ and someone else posted this: ‘Search‎‎ your BF’s number on my bio and prepare yourself for the results.’</p><p>A commenter wrote: ‘Why people keep messing with a woman who is clout chasing,’ and one other follower said: ‘Damn. I feel like at a certain age y’all really need to leave the streets alone.’</p><p>A fan posted this message: ‘He should’ve just kept hitting the blunt and kept scrolling,’ and another follower posted: ‘I can only imagine what she’s dealt with throughout the years. Yepp. He’s guilty. Men always wanna praise you after embarrassing you and being incapable of doing what they are praising you for.’</p><p>One follower cannot understand how Snoop could have anything to do with Celina: ‘Y’all just keep playing with her… she like ruining relationships🤣’ while another follower has the following opinion: ‘At this point give her a polygraph test. I will pay for it. No 🧢. Tag her in this comment.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you think Snoop is guilty?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejo7ywvIydpqCfXaXCo7jInKOyZaOdvLi%2FjKWmr51dlrulecCpp6udk56utbXOp2Stp12dtrR51qKdnmWWpLmtu9aipaBllqeytLSMnJ%2BemaSeu6h5wKWjnp%2BRqbawutJmpJqclWKvunnToZxmoZ6brq671KxknJ2cnruiec%2Borp6knGKAen%2BWcGlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
