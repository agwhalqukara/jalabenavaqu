Nancy’s departure from this world has left an indelible mark on the hearts of everyone who knew her. In honor of her life and contributions to the community, Oktaha Public School will transition to a District Wide (PreK – 12) Virtual Day on Monday, <strong>November 13, 2023, </strong>enabling faculty, staff, and students to attend Nancy Hubbard’s celebration of life service.</p><p><strong>About Nancy Hubbard Life:-</strong></p><p>Nancy began her journey at Oktaha in 1995, dedicating more than two decades of her life to nurturing young minds before retiring in 2017. She was much more than a cheer coach to her students. She was a second mom, a shoulder to cry on, and a beacon of unwavering support. Her role extended beyond the boundaries of the school, earning her the affectionate title of ‘Neena’ from the latest generation of Tigers.</p><p>Her love for the Oktaha community was palpable, and it didn’t end with her retirement. Whether it was a baseball or basketball game, Nancy was always there, cheering on her Tigers, embodying the spirit of unity and togetherness. Her presence at these games was a testament to her enduring dedication to the school and its students.</p><p>Nancy’s passing is a significant loss for the Oktaha community. However, her impact lives on in the countless lives she touched during her tenure at the school. As we mourn the loss of Nancy Hubbard, we also celebrate the extraordinary life she led and the remarkable legacy she leaves behind.</p><p>Our deepest condolences go out to her family, friends, and all those mourning during this difficult time. We remember Nancy not just as an excellent cheer coach but also as a compassionate mentor, a steadfast supporter, and a beloved member of our community. We love you, Nancy. Until we meet again, your spirit will continue to cheer us on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaopewsLjLnp6eZpmjfK%2BtzZywZqCll6%2BivsNmm6KdlGK8rMDAoZisZZKaubDCxJ1knKCVmr9ur86amqFll6S7pnnTqKZmq5%2Bku3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
