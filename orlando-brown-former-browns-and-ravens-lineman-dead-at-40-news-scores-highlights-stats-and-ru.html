"The symptoms may occur gradually, and people may not recognize them."</p><p>The 6'7", 360-pound tackle known as "Zeus" enjoyed a fruitful 10-year <a href=#>NFL</a> career, but he is probably best known for an incident that occurred in 1999 as a member of the Browns. During a game, referee Jeff Triplette threw a flag that accidentally hit Brown in the eye.</p><p>This prompted Brown to shove Triplette to the ground, and he was suspended as a result. Brown missed three seasons due to a resulting eye injury, but he settled with the NFL for $25 million in damages.</p><p>As shocking as that particular incident was, the circumstances surrounding his death may be even more surprising. It will be interesting to see whether the NFL institutes an early detection program for diabetes and related diseases on the heels of this tragic death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJob3FqaWh%2FbrvRpZinnJ9ir7O71qdknaGRl7K1sdJmq6hlkqGurrGMn6arZZSarrW0jKidZp6fp7qmvoybqaivnqh6orrDZqmarpWjwG64yKecppme</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
