He is not only an actor but also a really accomplished husband and a father. Richard tied the knot to his wife <strong>Gabriella Pession</strong> on September 3, 2016. Richard Flood’s wife is also a very talented American-born Italian actress. Both share a lovely child, a son named <strong>Giulio Flood</strong>.</p><p>Richard Flood’s son Giulio Flood was born on 22nd July 2014. Like all parents, Giulio’s parents are really cautious regarding him. They don’t usually post his picture on any social media platform, and even if they do post his picture, they generally don’t show his face. His mother posts pictures of him facing backward and the only thing we can see is his curly red hair. Another thing we know about him is his passion for art.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=An_Art_Lover_Artist></span>An Art Lover, Artist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Richard Flood’s son Giulio Flood loves painting and drawing. In fact, his mother likes to call him her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>little Picasso</a>. He not only plays with colors but also creates a masterpiece with them, a masterpiece that only little children like him understand. He is a really cute child, fuzzy and adorable.</p><p>Just look at the picture of him creating a masterpiece out of little cans of paint.</p><p>Nonetheless, the star kid also loves playing with his friends, having pets around him, and spending lots of time with papa Richard. Giulio’s father, despite a tight schedule, spends as much time possible with his little son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Richard-Flood-with-his-son.jpg><p>Both the father-son duo loves going on beaches and swim on a sunny day. Little Giulio’s mother is always near him, never letting her beloved son away from her sight. That’s what we call mother’s love, pure and delicate.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Happy_Family_Of_Three></span>A Happy Family Of Three<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>lives with his mama <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Gabriella</a> and papa Richard. The family of three loves a vacation, and the idea of visiting new places is always around the corner. They are amongst the people who enjoy the moment, and sitting under a tree with his mama is something Giulio is often seen doing. Plus according to his mother, he really likes watching the clouds pass by. In fact, the mother-son duo can be seen sitting around a park’s bench enjoying one another’s company. Not only his mother’s company but also his father’s company is the thing he adores.</p><p dir=ltr lang=it>Auguri papà mio ❤ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@floodie1</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kMlz58NerF</a></p><p>— Gabriella Pession (@gabpex) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">March 19, 2017</a></p><p>Furthermore, the Flood family loves doing adventurous stuff. They go on bicycle rides, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">skiing</a>, and visit exotic places. Giulio just loves chasing the wind and enjoys his parents’ company. It’s not life if it’s simple, there must be some complications to spice things up. Every family has a time when they have to face trouble, but putting on a happy face is a must. Same as that, the Flood family might also have faced problems, but we are sure that they have passed the test of time and stood strong. Seeing them enjoying one another’s company just makes us happy, and the family of three is perfect in every way.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Giulio_Flood_Name_Meaning></span>Giulio Flood Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Richard Flood’s son, Giulio Flood’s name, is of Italian origin meaning Youthful and Julio.</p><p>Click on <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Movies & TV Series,</strong></i></a> for more articles or just follow <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>eCelebrityMirror</strong></i></a>.</p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq7JlkpavqrHSaJ6irZyevG6yy6imnWWinrCprdGdZJ%2Bkn6Sxbr%2FOp2SgmZKntqa4y5pkqZ2jqLawuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
