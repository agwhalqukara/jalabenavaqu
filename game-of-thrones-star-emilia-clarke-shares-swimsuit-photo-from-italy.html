Clarke, 37, shared a series of pictures of her trip to the gorgeous country, sharing photos of the food, scenery, and herself looking happy in a swimsuit. "ðŸ˜ŽMAMMA MIA! ITALIA!! You will always have my heart, my summer, and my sea legs.. get the people you love, stick them on a boat and then by a pool, add Italian food and one too many bottles of prosecco and hey presto! You have peak relaxation. For full effects repeat once a year," she captioned the post. Here's how Clarke takes care of herself when she's not in Italy.</span></p><p><span>Clarke never sleeps through her alarm, as her morning ritual is a non-negotiable. "The morning time is for me to try and calm my brain down," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I do yoga every morning for 15 minutes. I meditate, then I get to my beauty care. I use a cleanser, toner and moisturizer. If I need it, I'll do a sheet mask; I use Rodial Pink Diamond. I'll put it on and get into the shower since I don't get my face wet. I'll also use a face roller after moisturizing. I use a foam roller in the morning and sometimes before I go to bed. With my job, I'm standing, fighting or doing a photoshoot and having meetings with people. I get home and just feel so tense. I might do an Epsom salt bath. Anything you can do to relax your muscles will allow your brain to relax, too. I'll journal, and if I have time I'll meditate. I sleep with an eye mask, a silk one."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_1676796109.jpg><p><span>Clarke has never had Botox or injectables, but says she won't rule it out down the road. "I work in an industry where I've got to move my face, and I've got to be expressive, and you can't light filler," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "You just can't light it. It doesn't look right, you look shiny and strange. If my job is telling me that I need to have anything more than possibly a bit of botox when I'm 45 or whatever, then I'll stop doing the job."</span></p><p><span>Clarke likes to give new beauty looks a trial run with a trip to her favorite UK grocery store. "It's going to sound really mad, but when I don't think I can pull off an eyeshadow or a lipstick, I'll do a little road test in Sainsbury's," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Pick a day where you're not doing too much, try on the lipstick and see how you feel walking down the street. Ask: 'Are people looking at me like I'm crazy? Do I feel good?' Then when you wear it to your event or party, it's not completely new to you. I did it recently with a bright coral lipstick and it's now my new favourite lip colour. It has allowed me to be bolder."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_1547903168.jpg><p><span>Clarke loves a hot bath at the end of the day. "I like to use half a tonne of Epsom salts in it and maybe a bit of lavender oil if I'm feeling fruity," she says. "I light candles, get my book out, have some classical music playing, all of that jazz. Then I do yoga every morning and, since lockdown, I've started meditating. I meditate every night using the Calm app. I find it's been a really helpful tool for if I'm having a panic in the day and I need to just take five minutes to breathe."</span></p><p><span>Clarke has learned to have a kinder inner voice since the pandemic lockdowns. "I've definitely learnt in lockdown to catch myself when my inner saboteur is raging strong, and to just be aware of it," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I came up with some mantras to practice kindness on myself. I know it sounds prescriptive, and normally all that self-love stuff makes me feel weird inside, but actually during lockdown I found my own way of doing it without feeling like a human Clintons card."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKitzJ5kqJ5dqbWzu82eqmarpJa%2FbrHMoqOimV2YuaK%2Byp5krKCRp7K0edKwoKarpZ7BbrzHqKuoZZanvK55yK2YpbFf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
