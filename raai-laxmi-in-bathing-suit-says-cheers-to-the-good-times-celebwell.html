"Such exercises also improve glucose metabolism, enhance maintenance of healthy body weight, and help improve cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure," says I-Min Lee, professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "All these factors lead to lower risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, which lowers mortality risk."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Laxmi is a skilled and talented </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>dancer</span></a><span>. "There's no question, anecdotally at least, that music has a very stimulating effect on physical activity," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Daniel Tarsy, MD</span></a><span>, an HMS professor of neurology and director of the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). "And I think that applies to dance, as well."</span></p><p><span>Laxmi enjoys swimming as part of her workouts. "It's no secret that aerobic exercise can help stave off some of the ravages of aging," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Seena Mathew</span></a><span>, Assistant Professor of Biology, University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. "But a growing body of research suggests that swimming might provide a unique boost to brain health. Regular swimming has been shown to improve memory, cognitive function, immune response and mood. Swimming may also help repair damage from stress and forge new neural connections in the brain."</span></p><p><span>Laxmi knows the importance of flexibility and stretching as part of her workouts. "A lot of people don't understand that stretching has to happen on a regular basis. It should be daily," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says David Nolan</span></a><span>, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. "It may have taken you many months to get tight muscles, so you're not going to be perfectly flexible after one or two sessions. It takes weeks to months to get flexible, and you'll have to continue working on it to maintain it."</span></p><p><span>Laxmi is passionate about yoga, and enjoys both the mental and physical aspects of the practice. "Yoga can help reduce risk factors for chronic diseases, such as heart disease and high blood pressure," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says the Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>. "Yoga may also help manage low back pain, neck pain and menopause symptoms. Yoga might also help relieve symptoms of several chronic conditions, such as pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, arthritis and insomnia."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkq5mRnnqtrdemoGahnmKvosDHoqWgZaOqtrV50pqwrGWTnbKmvtJmq6hlpJ2ybrPOqJtmrJmisrR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
