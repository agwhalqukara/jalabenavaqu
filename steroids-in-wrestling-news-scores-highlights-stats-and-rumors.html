These wrestlers included Rey&nbsp;Mystereo, Randy Orton, Johnny Morrison (when he was Johnny Nitro), Mr. Kennedy, Edge, and several more.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy said on Live television after the suspension that since he joined the WWE he was tested frequently for steroids.</p><p>"We do not take drugs. We have a drug&nbsp;policy in place, and get tested regularly. I do not take steroids," said Mr. Kennedy in an inteview. "If the testosterone level is above 4-to-1, then the wrestler will get immediately suspended or fired. I think there used to be a steroid problem, but now there isn't one anymore."</p><p>There is a good argument that all wrestlers who used steroids, or still use them, are from a different era (several years ago) where a high percentage of wrestlers on several different brands used them.</p><p>Hulk Hogan, one of the most famous wrestlers of all time, admitted to using steroids for many years during his wrestling career. It is reported that Hogan had blamed Vince McMahon, but there was classification on that.</p><p>The reason why steroids has become such a discussion in recent years is because of the several deaths that have occured such as Eddie Guerrero, Chris Beniot, Ross Haas, and Bill Pullman. Most of the steroid related deaths involved heart attacks, but in Chris Beniot's case police found steroids in his house when they found Chris and his wife and son dead.</p><p>During an interview with FOX News&nbsp;Mr. Kennedy stated, "All the match results are decided before the matches."</p><p>So if the wrestlers know who's going to win the match, then why do they need to use steroids? Is it for appearance? To see who has got the biggest muscles? If so, how pathetic are they, honestly? Why would you purposely harm your body to look better?</p><p>Thank you, and good night San Diego</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaHFqYWyEbr%2FTnqmooZSoeqq6jLCpnqukobavsw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
