I truly did not realize how much my extra weight did slow me down until after I started losing a substantial amount of weight. I would always tell others I could get around just fine, but truthfully, I was just telling myself that as a form of denial. Little things like climbing a simple flight of stairs was difficult to do without huffing and puffing. My weight did hinder me from small things that most people take for granted. I was determined not to be fat in my fifties — my forties were my heaviest years.</p><p><a href=#>Related Story: Paula Lost More Than 100 Pounds to Be Healthy for Her Kids!</a></p><ul><li>How did you get started with your weight loss journey?</li></ul><p>In 2007, I started a ‘Biggest Loser’ contest at the school where I was working to motivate myself to lose the weight. [Later] I started the Atkins plan… and my weight started dropping. I cut out sugars and carbs. I eat Atkins frozen meals for lunch and usually have an Atkins meal bar or shake. When I had major back surgery last June, my exercise program came to a screeching halt — I have had to build my exercise program back up since then. When I was in full swing I would work out at least five times a week [by walking or using the elliptical].</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pat-weight-loss-after.jpg><p>Pat after her 112-pound weight loss.</p><ul><li>What were the most difficult aspects of losing the weight?</li></ul><p>It has been a long journey. I had some tough days trying to stay motivated, especially those plateau days everyone hits. I also love to cook, bake and entertain [so] that aspect of my life sometimes makes [dieting] hard. The good news is if I want to indulge in the foods I can’t eat on a regular basis, l do… I just can’t eat carbs, fried foods and sugars on a daily basis. With this much weight loss comes a few physical issues, too. I have a lot of loose skin. It’s not pretty… and it is a daily reminder of the weight issues I have dealt with throughout my life. I am hoping to one day be able to get it surgically removed.</p><ul><li>How does it feel now that you’ve lost the weight?</li></ul><p>I feel great. I will always follow the <a href=#>Atkins</a> plan. Not only do I feel great, but I am healthier and I have a lot more energy. I feel pretty. I have had such fun rebuilding my wardrobe. I tell everyone, if l can do this, anyone can achieve their weight loss goals. I’m just a 55-year-old grandma — no gimmicks, just work, diet and sheer determination!</p><p>To submit your own weight loss story, email (<a href=#>jbirkinbine@bauerxcel.com</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e9aeoKCgpGK5sL%2FSZq6enJ6awKWt2GalopufobJuuM6sq2ZwYGK9sMHNnapmrJ9ir6Z5wGanqKuZqba3sYyrpqWdXaK8pbHLZp2oql2dsrN5w5qsoKCkmr9ugZNvZ2k%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
