The former Hills star wed William Tell in Santa Ynez have been engaged since October of 2013. They were introduced in 2012 when they were set up on a blind date for Valentine’s Day, and things just worked out for the adorable couple. Now they’re officially husband and wife. The 28-year-old designer has been very open about the wedding planning process, and now she’s a bride.</p><p>Her wedding was a big one. The celebrity designer had 9 bridesmaids, including her former reality star roommate and friend, Lo Bosworth. Each of her 9 maids wore a custom-made dress from Conrad’s fashion line, Paper Crown.</p><p>“I sent them all the different shapes and let them pick from two colors. I don’t mind if there are a few girls in the same dress, or if people are in all different ones. I think that weddings are about celebrating, and you want everyone to feel comfortable,” she said to Martha Stewart when she unveiled her new line of bridal accessories and bridesmaids gowns in August.</p><p>“Everyone is so happy for her. He’s such a great guy. They are perfect for each other,” said friends of the couple who were in attendance for the wedding, which was reportedly very lovely. Details have not been announced just yet, but it’s only a matter of time before photos of the bride and groom find their way on to the internet and everyone begins discussing who wore what, what was served and where exactly the wedding was held. We know, however, that the wedding was a classic one, because it fits the bride’s style and elegant nature. The two are reportedly enjoying their honeymoon at the moment, and we wish them congratulations and well wishes as they enjoy their first vacation as husband and wife.</p><p>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images for Veuve Clicquot)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGijmq2imrtur86nqZqcXam2pr%2BMpKWorF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
