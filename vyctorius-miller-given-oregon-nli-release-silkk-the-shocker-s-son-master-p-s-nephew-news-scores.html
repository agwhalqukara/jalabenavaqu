He is also the cousin of Mercy Miller, a four-star recruit in the Class of 2024 who is committed to Houston and is Master P's son.</p><p>Vyctorius Miller is also rated as a four-star recruit, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247 Sports</a>, and had received 15 scholarship offers. He made official visits to USC, LSU and Cal before committing to the Ducks in November 2023.</p><p>Miller is rated as the No. 53 overall player, the No. 15 shooting guard and the No. 3 player from Arizona in the Class of 2024, per 247. He has a 6'5", 170-pound frame and was described as having "advanced ball skills and footwork for the position" by 247's <a href=# rel=noopener>Travis Branham</a>.</p><p>Following his departure, the Ducks only have one player signed to the <a href=# rel=noopener>2024 class</a>. That is Ibrahima Traore, a three-star center from Florida. The Ducks are set to join the Big Ten Conference for the 2024-25 season, and finished its tenure in the Pac-12 strong with a conference tournament championship and a trip to the second round of the NCAA Tournament.</p><p>Miller will search for a new home for next season, and USC, LSU and Gonzaga would appear to be the current favorites to land him after the programs were <a href=# rel=noopener>finalists</a> in his original recruitment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmGenyMr7CcrJ%2Bntra%2FjKagpaSVp3qotdWepWanopq0sLqMp6OiZaKauaat0p5krKGcoLhuwMeeZKygn5i4pr7SZqqopl2irrTAxKtkqatdo7KxtMSw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
