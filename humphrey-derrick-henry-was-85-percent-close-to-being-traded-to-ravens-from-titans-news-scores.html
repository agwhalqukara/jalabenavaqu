The lone exception was when he rushed for 937 yards and 10 scores in just eight games in 2021.</p><p>King Henry led the NFL in rushing in 2019 (1,540 yards) and 2020 (2,027 yards), and he rushed for 1,538 yards last season as well.</p><p>He has also rushed for a remarkable 72 touchdowns in 79 games dating back to the 2018 season.</p><p>In the first game of the 2023 campaign, the Ravens lost starting running J.K. Dobbins for the season with a torn Achilles, which has largely forced them to go with the combination of Gus Edwards and Justice Hill in the backfield.</p><p>Baltimore has not missed a beat, as its 7-2 record is tied with the Kansas City Chiefs for the best mark in the AFC.</p><p>With quarterback Lamar Jackson at the controls, the Ravens rushed for 298 yards as a team in a 37-3 drubbing of the Seattle Seahawks this past weekend.</p><p>Jackson, Edwards and Hill all contributed to the ground game, but the breakout star was undrafted rookie Keaton Mitchell, who rushed for 138 yards and a touchdown on nine carries.</p><p>Given Mitchell's showing and how successful Baltimore's ground game has been, Humphrey suggested Wednesday that the Ravens may not have needed a star running back like Henry after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWuCdYKMoaymqJinsrp5w56pq6GToHqpsc2rsGavkah6eYGMqZyrm5WjwW6vy6iqnmWkpHqjscinnmasopaxprCMraZmqpGrsq%2B%2FjJ%2BpqKVdqba1rc2s</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
