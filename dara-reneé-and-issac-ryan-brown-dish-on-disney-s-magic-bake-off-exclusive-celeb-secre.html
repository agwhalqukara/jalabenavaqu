I mean, I’m learning so much and I get to eat cake as a job,” said Reneé. “Like what more could you ask for? I mean, the crew was excellent.The young bakers continued to amaze me and working with Isaac has been a dream come true. Icon right over here, period.”</p><p>“Imma have to bounce it right back at Dara. It’s been a dream come true…” said Brown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/159246_1721-1024x683.jpg><p><span>When watching these incredible bakers put their talents to use and elevate their skills, it’s easy to see why Renee and Brown have been having such a blast on set. The pair shared that amongst all categories evaluated during the baking competition — design, taste, overall presentation and creativity — creativity holds the most special place in both of their hearts.</span></p><p><span>“On top of overall presentation, another category we usually have is creativity. I think that’s really a big one. A big category is usually creativity because it’s like, you love to see what kids do with the idea you give them. I can tell you, ‘You know, I want a three layer, swiss meringue buttercream based on Toy Story,’ but then you put your own thing on it,” said Brown. “You can do your own thing on top of all of the challenges that were so beautifully packaged together by Tastemade. It just feels a lot more personal and it makes the cake a lot more enjoyable.”</span></p><p><span>“I would say creativity as well,” expressed Reneé. “I mean these young bakers execute everything so brilliantly and to add taste on top of that. Ooh, I’m so glad like I don’t have to judge. Like, I’m so glad, like Gracie, our Disney chef, who’s absolutely amazing, handles that because I would not be able to pick.”</span></p><p><span>You can watch our full interview with Dara Reneé and Issac Ryan Brown below to learn more about the sweet show, and to find out some behind-the-scenes secrets from on set!</span></p><p>New episodes of Disney’s Magic Bake-Off air every Friday @ 8PM ET/PT on Disney Channel and DisneyNOW.
