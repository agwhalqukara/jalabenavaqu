Paris made it clear that she can’t wait to have babies with her fiance, as soon as they officially tie the knot!</p><p>This and more, including whether or not she plans on changing her famous last name after marriage, was revealed in a preview clip for her brand new podcast titled This Is Paris.</p><p>While chatting about her future, Paris looked past the wedding which is yet to happen and let her listeners know that ‘I cannot wait to have a family with him….it is something that I have really been looking forward to. It is something we have talked about a lot ever since we have been together… First the wedding, then babies.’</p><p>This comes after Paris also confirmed that she’s been going through IVF to get ready for a first pregnancy so it’s clear that she has babies on her mind.</p><p>Carter Reum popped the big question while the two of them were celebrating her 40th birthday on a romantic getaway on February 17.</p><p>On the podcast, Paris admitted that she expected her man to ask her to marry him, which he did!</p><p>She would apparently speculate that ‘there going to be like a ring showing up inside the cake, like a little seashell’ while enjoying dinner together.</p><p>Another thought going through her mind at the time was that ‘mermaids were going to swim up’ to her with the engagement ring.</p><p>Instead, she recalled how it actually all happened, saying: ‘He opened the box and it had like a light shown on the ring, and it was sparkling…it was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life, and I put it on and freaked out.’<br>Much simpler than what she was thinking but definitely very efficient!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As for the name change situation, Paris shared that ‘I am going to take [his name], but I feel like a hyphenated form like Paris Hilton-Reum [instead], because my name is my name. I like it.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeglr%2Bqv4yhoKWsn6N6tK3YrGSsoJVisKK602aumqGkYsGwedKtmKusXZZ6p63MoqOyZaeewal5wpqprZ2iYr%2BmwcxmmJ%2Bslad6qLHTraCnn12irrO%2ByJ6bZq%2BZobluv8eeZK2Zm5p6qbXSZqWapZVigXiDlWpraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
