As you’ll see in a few years, the ability to forgive and show mercy is what will ultimately allow Luke Skywalker to defeat the Emperor and save his father.</p><p>We see here Obi-Wan practicing what he preaches, even as the ultimate evil is on his knees, waiting for the Jedi Master to finish him off. Obi-Wan doesn’t give in and instead spares his former apprentice’s life, while coming to terms with the fact that he can’t save Anakin.</p><h2>Why didn’t Reva kill Luke Skywalker and what’s next for her?</h2><p>For many of the same continuity reasons Darth Vader couldn’t die in this series: Luke still has a lot to do in the decades to come. Reva didn’t stand a chance against the plot armor protecting the future hero of the Rebellion and the last of the Jedi. But there’s a deeper meaning, too. By sparing Luke’s life, Reva makes a huge decision about her future. She refuses to become the monster she’s spent most of her life trying to take down. Were she to strike down a defenseless child, Reva would be no better than the Sith Lord who killed her fellow younglings during Order 66.</p><p>By the end of the episode, Reva begins to realize that her thirst for revenge almost led her down a path from which she would never return. The former Jedi chooses to let her anger with Anakin and Obi-Wan go, seemingly tossing it aside in the desert along with her lightsaber. Obi-Wan encourages Reva to find a new path and not let the survivor’s guilt she’s felt for most of her life control her.</p><p>But where will Reva go next? Abandoning her weapon on Tatooine suggests that Reva is leaving the endless conflict between the light and dark sides of the Force behind. She’s clearly done with the Empire but likely has no interest in revisiting the trauma of becoming a Jedi Knight, either. Like many Legends characters before her, she could choose to leave her connection to the Force behind entirely in order to start fresh. What will she do without the Force or a lightsaber? Well, that’s a story just waiting to be told in a spinoff series!</p><h2>What’s next for Princess Leia and the Organas on Alderaan?</h2><p>Princess Leia, and her parents Bail and Breha Organa, get a very happy ending on <strong>Obi-Wan Kenobi</strong>. Finally reunited on Alderaan, the Organa family bids farewell to Obi-Wan, hopeful for better days to come. Obi-Wan tells Bail that he knows where to find the Jedi if he ever needs his help again, but the Senator replies that he hopes that day will never come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOrKuaql2srrO%2FjKiZomWnlrtut8SnppuhXZq7pbXNoGSesKChrqq6xJ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
