"Cooking is my sanity, my joy and my way of showing the people that I love that I appreciate them. I have no children, so my friends are the recipients of my maternal love. When I cook homemade meals for them, when the soufflé turns out perfectly, I feel that anything else … any negative minutia of life cannot affect me, I am at peace."</span></p><p><span>Bruce Boxlietner played John Sheridan from seasons 2 to 5. He talked about how he feels about his career to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Smashing Interviews Magazine.</span></a><span> "I don't think there's anyone in this business that doesn't have regrets. Maybe you should have gone one way, and you didn't, or there was a role you were offered, and you turned it down. Everybody has those in this business. But, no, I've got to tell you that I'm very blessed. Actually I've been very, very blessed for the most part for the paths my career has taken.</span><span>"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-1542415329.jpg><p><span>Phil LaMarr played Stephen Franklin in </span><i><span>The Road Home. </span></i><span>In an interview with</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> Twin Cities Geek</span></a><span>, he talked about the importance of diversity when it comes to voice acting. "Diversity and representation weren't buzzwords, but they were in the minds of people who had raw vision," he said. </span><span>"We need new stories; we need new perspectives. That's what makes things interesting."</span></p><p><span>Julie Caitlin Brown played Na'Toth in season one.

"There are always cultural differences, this is the way of the world.&nbsp; There can be a bias against women, their can be a problem with language and customs, there can be socio-economic issues that must be considered.&nbsp; I take into account all of these things when I am negotiating a contract.</span><span>"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-1210820191.jpg><p><span>Bill Mumy played Lennier in the first five seasons. He talked about his career in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>FOX News</span></a><span>. </span><span>"I've been very fortunate to work in so many areas of show business and be professionally rewarded for that," he said. "But I will say it's a hard thing to adjust to when millions of people watch you perform week after week and then one day nobody is paying any attention to you. I can see how that can be troubling. But you know, I just kept finding a slot to work in. I never suffered financially like many other child actors whose parents spend their money. My parents invested and they kept me humble."</span></p><p><span>Beata Pozniak played President Susanna Luchenko on the show. She is an immigrant, and has worked to empower women. Pozniak also was a factor in making International Women's Day a holiday. She talked about her activism with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Voyage LA</span></a><span>. "</span><span>The most proud thing I have done is to have met and found women that are inspirational — giving voice to the immigrants, who came here for a safer life. In searching for my new self, for my new identity, I wanted to find other immigrants, women from different walks of life that could serve as a positive role model. I met so many extraordinary immigrant women, from Ghana to Japan that words can't even describe how uplifting their stories were. Therefore, in 1994, I spearheaded the introduction of the first bill in the history of the U.S. Congress (H.J. Res. 316) to recognize International Women's Day in the United States. I wanted to celebrate the diversity of this great country.</span><span>"</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKK5wLOgp59dl7yltcSsZKieXZeuo8XLqKVmbV2owaK%2B0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
