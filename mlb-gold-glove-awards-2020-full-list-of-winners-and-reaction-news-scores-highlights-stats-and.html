The Detroit Tigers were second at 1,096.</p><p>The Rays had the AL's best record and reached the World Series in large part because they have built an elite defensive club. They led MLB in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FanGraphs</a>' defensive value (16.8) and were fifth in defensive runs saved (24).</p><p>Some of the names on the Gold Glove winners list are familiar. Nolan Arenado remains a steady rock at third base for the Colorado Rockies. This marks his eighth consecutive Gold Glove in eight years since making his MLB debut in 2013.</p><p>Arenado led all players in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FanGraphs</a>' defensive value (9.3) and defensive runs saved (15). Joey Gallo of the Texas Rangers was second in the latter category with 12.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXJpZGiBc3nMpZlmn5%2BhsW6zy6itnmWRrK6zsNJmaWlqYGKztrjLZqOiq6RivKd51qKlp52iqHqiusNmqZ6Zk6m2sLo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
