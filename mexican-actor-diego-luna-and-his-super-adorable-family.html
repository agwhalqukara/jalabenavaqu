He says he used to talk to her at night from his dreams, he knew what she looked like. The Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (2004) actor further attributed some of these experiences to his love for Star Wars as a kid, the movie franchise made him believe in the supernatural force and according to him, it made him close to his late mother.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Alejandro Luna </strong>(full name&nbsp;José Alejandro Dionisio Luna Ledesma)&nbsp;(father)</p><p><img decoding=async title="Diego Luna's dad Alejandro Luna" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Diego-Luna-family-father-Alejandro-Luna.jpg alt="Diego Luna's family - father Alejandro Luna" width=800 height=466 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> December 1, 1939</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Sagittarius</p><p style=text-align:justify>Alejandro is a famed Mexican scenic designer and lightning technician.
