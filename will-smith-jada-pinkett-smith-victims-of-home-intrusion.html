Archer was charged by the DA's office on Monday for trespassing and refusing to leave private property.</p><p>The DA's office told <strong>Us</strong> in a press release late Monday that Archer pleaded no contest late Monday afternoon for entering the couple's home and remaining on the premises. A retraining order was issued, which prohibits Archer from coming 150 yards from the family's home as well as individual members of the famous Hollywood quartet.&nbsp;</p><p>She was also sentenced to three years of summary probation.</p><p>Thankfully, the superstar couple and their kids, <strong>Willow </strong>and <strong>Jaden</strong>, were not home at the time of the trespassing.</p><p>The Magic Mike XXL actress recently opened up to <a href=#>Haute Living</a> in its July 2015 issue about expanding her real estate portfolio.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It was great to nurture my East Coast side. I’ve been in L.A. for [20 years]—[but now] I’m an East Coast girl with some serious West Coast maneuvering skills," she told the mag. "I’m keeping my apartment in New York because my son is working on a project here."</p><p>In <a href=#>a separate interview several weeks ago</a>, Pinkett Smith, 43, shared some insight on what it's like usually inside her Calabasas home. "It's so funny when your sons get to those teen years," Pinkett Smith told SiriusXM host Howard Stern. "And they're like, 'Hey ma, I've got friends coming over…. and my friend is really feeling you.'"</p><p>The stepmom to<strong> Trey,</strong> 22, and mom to<strong> Jaden</strong>, 16, said her teenage son asks her to "tone it down" with the risqué outfits around their mansion. "He's such a sweetheart," she proudly noted.
