The star will be honored with a Generation Award at this year’s 2022 MTV Movie & TV Awards in recognition of her many accomplishments.</p><p>The TV channel announced the good news on Friday, the event itself will take place this Sunday. The show, hosted by Vanessa Hudgens, will air live from Santa Monica on MTV at 8:00 pm ET. The award highlights the impact J.Lo has had on modern culture, as it is given to actors whose contribution to film and television is hard to overestimate.</p><p>Previous recipients of the award include Scarlett Johansson, Dwayne “The Rock ” Johnson, Chris Pratt, Will Smith, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Wahlberg, Sandra Bullock, Jamie Foxx, Johnny Depp, Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler, Mike Myers, Tom Cruz, Jim Carrey and all of the Fast and Furious Franchise.</p><p>In addition, Aquafina will present the Genius of Comedy Award to Jack Black, along with other hosts, including Billy Eichner, Chris Evans, and Rebel Wilson. In any case, the fun promises to be hot, as Snoop Dogg himself will perform as a DJ on this holiday. But let’s remember the accomplishments of the American star who was inspired by the support and faith of her loyal fans.</p><p>Lopez first made her way into the light back in 1991 as a dancer for the Fly Girl troupe on the television show In Living Color, and after received her breakthrough role on the big screen in the 1997 film Selena. Even if you do not take into account the fact that the films with her participation have collected more than $ 3 billion at the box office, she is the only performer who has managed to become number one in completely different areas.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Jennifer recently returned to the screen with the romantic comedy First Man You Meet and will soon be featured in the Halftime documentary, which premieres on Netflix on June 14.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamruvtcWeqWakn6Wyu3nTqGSpqpWosq%2FAjKCcp52ilsGqu81mmLCZopl6osCMpquvZZ2kw6qxjK2tZpmnlr%2Blv4xrZ2tqXWp%2Fc4WPb2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
