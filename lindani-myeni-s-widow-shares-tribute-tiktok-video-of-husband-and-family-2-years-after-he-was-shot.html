He had two toddlers with his American wife Lindsay at the time of his death.</p><p class=align-left>The two fell in love and married 18 months after meeting at a hotel in <a href=#>Durban</a> in 2015. They later moved to the USA where Lindsay’s real estate career was based.</p><p class=align-left>As a <a href=#>mixed-race couple</a>, they often felt severe discrimination, with Myeni facing routine police harassment.

It seems like every time a cop kills, they never do anything to punish them."<h2>Lindani Myeni shot in fake 911 burglary call, video evidence shows he was calm</h2><p class=align-left>Myeni was shot four times after police responded to a burglary call, and a scuffle ensued. The police claimed that they were responding to a 911 burglary call and Myeni attacked them.</p><p class=align-left>However, Lindsay alleged in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrongful death lawsuit</a> that police were motivated by racial discrimination against an unarmed, peaceful black man.</p><p class=align-left>Two months after his killing, a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">body cam and doorbell video</a> emerged, showing a different story from what the police claimed. The videos show Myeni calmly taking off his shoes and walking into the house he mistook for a religious temple. A woman in the house then screams hysterically and calls the police.</p><p class=align-left>After a few confused moments, the video shows Myeni humbly apologising to the homeowners before leaving the house.</p><p class=align-left>A few minutes later, body cam footage from the police officers showed them firing a taser at Myeni before shooting him dead. It is only then they identified themselves as police.</p><h2>Was Lindani Myeni killed in a racial profiling incident?</h2><p class=align-left>In 2021, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported on the crowdsourcing campaign to raise money to <a id=https://briefly.co.za/98554-we-are-grieving-you-r200k-raised-bring-lindani-myeni-home.html href=#>bring Myeni's remains back</a> to <a href=#>South Africa</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The campaign was successful and afterwards during a press briefing in Pretoria, <a href=#>Lindsay said</a>:</p>"They [the police] abused their rights and shot him dead because he had a heavy Zulu/ English accent and was a black man."<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLGxzqmjnmeWlrqquNhmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpq19mg3GAlGxkpaGema6vtYymsJ6mmWLEqrDOsGSloZ6ZwKLFjK2popqlqbJuwMikq6ijXau2pbHOZp2apZmhxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
