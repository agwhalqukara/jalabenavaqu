The agreement was set to pay him $210.6 million between 2023 and 2026, ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Adam Schefter</a> reported at the time.</p><p>It's unclear how Mahomes' latest restructure will impact the previous agreement, if at all.</p><p>It's no surprise the two-time MVP agreed to another restructure as the Chiefs aim to become the first team in NFL history to win three straight Super Bowl titles after claiming the Lombardi Trophy in each of the last two seasons.</p><p>Kansas City has already lost a number of free agents this offseason, including linebacker Willie Gay, offensive lineman Nick Allegretti and punter Tommy Townsend. The team also placed the franchise tag on cornerback L'Jarius Sneed, who <a href=#>could be traded</a> if no long-term agreement is reached.</p><p>As for signings, the Chiefs have re-signed star defensive tackle Chris Jones, safety Deon Bush and linebacker Drue Tranquill. The franchise's lone <a href=# rel=noopener>free-agent addition</a> as of Tuesday is tight end Irv Smith Jr.</p><p>The cap space created in the restructuring of Mahomes' contract could be used to negotiate a long-term extension for Sneed. It could also be used to bring in some more reliable targets for the star quarterback as the Kansas City offense was plagued by dropped balls last season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWeEen%2BMp52lZaKqurC%2B0maaoaGVm8BuvMCtqaKbm2K6orTOppysZaKawLW%2B1JyrrqqVqHqku82tqZqbpGKwrbHAq6pmamFrum61zWaamqhdqL2ir8Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
