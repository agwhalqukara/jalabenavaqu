Whilst the track was inspired by the film’s themes of togetherness and friendship, ‘Together In This’ is also so relatable during the current pandemic, reminding us that whilst we may be apart, we’re never alone.</p><p>A music video for ‘Together In This’ has also been unveiled.

The song ‘Together in This’ came about after my friend and acclaimed songwriter, Jonas Myrin, called me about a track he wrote for Jungle Beat: The Movie with my voice in mind. &nbsp;When he told me what the song was about, I knew I wanted to be a part of the project. &nbsp;I feel so much joy singing a song that promotes togetherness during this challenging time. It really tapped into the joy that my son gives me, and I hope it brings joy to other families as well.”</p><p>Jonas added, “Music has the power to unite, heal and uplift us. So in these difficult times, I wanted to write an anthem of hope for the world. We are stronger together and with love and faith in our hearts, together, we can get through this.”</p><p>Sandcastle Studios Producer Rita Mbanga said: “Together in This’ is such a timely song, and we’re so grateful to Jonas who did an incredible job writing the song, and to Natasha who did a spectacular job performing it. In this time in our world we so desperately need voices and messages of hope, and we really believe our film and the song will inspire unconditional love and acceptance in a world which needs an abundance of both.”</p><p>‘Together In This’ is the official end title track for Jungle Beat: The Movie, which recently premiered as part of the official feature selection of the digital edition of the Annecy International Animation Festival.
