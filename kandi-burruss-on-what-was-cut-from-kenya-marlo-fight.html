Marlo then suggested that Kenya shouldn’t come on the trip.</p><p>On <strong><a href=#>Kandi Burruss</a></strong>’ <a href=# rel=noopener>Speak On It</a>, the artist spoke with&nbsp;<strong>Fatum Alford</strong>&nbsp;– both were present during the fight – and revealed that much of it was edited out.</p><p>“It was a lot more than <a href=#>what you guys saw</a>,” said Kandi. “That argument that they had was so crazy, they were so disrespectful at some of the stuff they were saying to each other… They didn’t even show some of the stuff that she was saying to Kenya… I felt they showed more of what Kenya said to her, but they didn’t play any of the comments that Marlo was saying about—”</p><p>“—her daughter,” answered Fatum. “That was brutal, that was brutal. I was just like, ‘no, don’t do that.’”</p><p>Kandi added, “It was crazy… They didn’t show that… Some of the things that Marlo was saying was going way below. And yeah it was very bad. I’m not even gonna repeat some of that stuff.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kandi & Fatum say there’s alot that was cut from Marlo & Kenya’s argument, including comments Marlo made about Brooklyn. <a href=# rel=noopener>#RHOA</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>pic.twitter.com/bs22EAoD4b</a></p><p>— jay (@JaysRealityBlog) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 25, 2022</a></p><p>On <a href=# rel=noopener>Out Loud </a>with <strong><a href=#>Claudia Jordan</a></strong>, Marlo recently said the “streets are saying” that Kenya didn’t use her own eggs, regarding her daughter <strong>Brooklyn</strong>. The star insinuated that Kenya changes her story for the camera.</p><p>“Everyone wants to live this life, and they don’t want people to know this, but they want them to know this. Tell the real deal. It’s a reality show. Live in your reality. Live in your reality or don’t do the show. It’s not a soap opera. It’s not a script that I have to rehearse every day.”</p><p>Marlo then shaded other storylines.</p><p>“I feel a lot of these girls come on [and] they lie <a href=#>about their finances</a>, they lie about their fertility issues, they lie about their finances. They’re not real. And it’s like, ‘hey, you’re cheating your f**king fans.’”</p><p>Was the Brooklyn rumor originally in the footage? Is this the missing piece of their fight? Only a handful of times (it seems) has Bravo censored a rumor from airing. In several of these instances, the allegation involved a child.</p><p><a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</strong> </a>currently airs Sunday nights at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6too5Gjsap5wa6pq62jqHqwuoywn5qsXayutHnCrqtmnqKkum63xKewmmWdlr%2Btu4yfoKCgpGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
