A Spectacular Star-Studded Party Photos Show All Their Kids, Toya Wright</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>T.I. just turned 39 a few days ago, and the rapper celebrated his birthday in style. His wife, Tiny Harris, was quick to share some beautiful moments of the two, along with an endearing message for her husband’s birthday.</p><p>The message pointed out that T.I. was not just a husband but also a best friend to Tiny, and she expressed her deep love and admiration for him, and for the fact that he loved her as nobody else did.</p><p>She added that he was the man of her dreams, and exclaimed that she was pleased in her relationship with him.</p><p>The petite Xscape diva wrote: “Happy birthday to my husband, my best friend!! Thank you for loving me like no one else can. As I’ve always said, you are the man of my dreams. 20yrs strong & we loving on each other like we just met. Thank you for being the best for you!! You complete me. Celebrating you everyday!! Now eat the 🎂 Big Daddy. 👑💘👅”</p><p>It did not take long for people to start commenting on Tiny’s post as well, with many chiming in with their positive comments, while others took the opportunity to throw in some jokes about her relationship with T.I.</p><p>Everything was in good humor, though, and it was clear that Tiny’s fans were on board with her congratulating her husband for his birthday.</p><p>T.I.P. had a huge party with Toya Wright, Reginae Carter, Phaedra Parks and all his children including King, Zonnique Pullins, Major, and baby Heiress.</p><p>Deyjah, Majesty, and Domani were most likely in attendance but were not featured in the photos.</p><p>There is also some speculation that Tiny might be planning something more special for her husband for the coming week as well, although it is not entirely clear what that might be.</p><p>There have been various suggestions from her millions of fans, and people on social media have been flooding Tiny’s posts with various ideas of their own.</p><p>However, at this point, fans have to wait and see whether Tiny has been preparing anything indeed. T.I.’s wife has been known for her somewhat secretive nature from time to time, so it would not be surprising if this turned out to be true.</p><p>One fan said this: “Happy Blessed Birthday OG keep inspiring and shedding light for the future we listening 💪🏽💯”</p><p>Another commenter stated: “Yall one couple that can NEVER split! Ion care hard it gets!! I said NEVER. 🤝👑♥️😂”</p><p>A third commenter claimed: “❤️❤️❤️ For Better or Worse… Happy Birthday to one of my Fave’s “The King” @troubleman31 #YouKnowWhatItIs.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>T.I.P. definitely felt the love on that special day.</p><span><a href=# rel=prev><img width=150 height=27 alt="Next Article" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeknru6eceaqauho2LBqb7OsKpmrF2eeqJ50qmcnKyRmMKtrdFmqq2ZomLAtcHDnZydZaCWv7XFjKmfqKyfqHq0tM6wZJqknGLBqbHIq2SkoZSoerW72JpksKqZnLW1ec%2BhmJ6copZ6sa3RpKpmmZ6Zeq670Z5koZmmnruoecBmnqudkal6tbXMnmRsamVnhHR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
