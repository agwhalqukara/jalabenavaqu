Bella doesn‚Äôt shy away from her sexuality, but some feel that sexualizing girl scouts isn‚Äôt something that should be done, especially in the MeToo generation. Girls must be between the ages of 5-years-old and 18-years-old to be a girl scout, and most girls who sell cookies with the organization are minors.</p><p>Because of this, some feel that Bella Thorne‚Äôs sexualizing the girl scouts is inappropriate.</p><p>Before revealing her girl scout costume, Bella showed off her incredible makeup art skills by sharing several photos where she looked as if she had been beaten with a bloody lip, a black eye, and bruises on her face.</p><p>Those photos went viral and many thought she was giving hints about her Halloween costume but on Wednesday, Bella unveiled the photos of her wearing the girl scouts costume.</p><p>Bella shared the following caption with the controversial photos.</p><p>‚ÄúCOOKIE DELIVERY üòç.‚Äù</p><p>You may see the controversial photos of Bella Thorne dressed up as a girl scout below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4QLe8RndUb/</p><p>The photo has more than 600,000 likes and over 1700 comments.
