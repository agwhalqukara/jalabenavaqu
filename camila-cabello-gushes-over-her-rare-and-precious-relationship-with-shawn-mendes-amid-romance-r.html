During a brand new interview, the singer mentioned that she knows they are going to always be in each other’s lives and that is a great feeling to have.</p><p>Romance or not, Camila and Shawn have something truly rare and she was not afraid to make that clear.</p><p>While chatting with Clash, she sweetly said that: ‘I’ve never had many friends. I have always just had few people in my life who I trust. I feel like it is so rare to meet somebody in this industry and find a person of this quality, and I feel like Shawn’s that person for me. I trust him, and no matter the level of intensity he has around his career or which I have, he’s just normal, and that’s so rare and precious to find in this industry.’</p><p>As you know, the two artists collabed on the song Señorita and the track as well as the video present a fiery story of love, seduction and passion, showing Camila and Shawn kissing and embracing in sultry scenes quite a lot!</p><p>Since they did so much PDA, it makes sense that the romance rumors started going around as soon as the music video dropped.</p><p>Camila explained during the interview why they were so comfortable about it.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘It’s one of the most natural things in the world for he and I to do a song together. I think I have actually known him the longest out of anyone in the music industry – we have been in each other’s lives for like four or five years, and it has been really beautiful to grow up together… It’s actually a beautiful feeling to know this person is always going to be in my life, we are always going to love each other.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTlrqquMBmmpqalaG5sHnGrqqhnaNivLex0Wafnqpdp66zsYyapZ1loKeypLXOrqpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsSqwMdmqqGZp6N6rrHNnZysZZGitqV50aikmqaTmnqzwcyoqaxlY2V%2Ben%2BQaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 LoopBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
