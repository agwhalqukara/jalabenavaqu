She’s since won awards – Tonys, Oscars, Emmys, Grammys – and has reached career highs she only dreamed of as a child. What about her personal life?</p><p><strong>Jennifer Hudson is not married. She was once engaged to former fiance David Otunga, with whom she shares a son.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_129499217.jpg><p>Jennifer Hudson has met quite a few ups, downs, twists, and turns over the last decade. Here’s what we have on that side of her life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jennifer Hudson’s husband?</h2><p>Many people have assumed that <a href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Hudson and David Otunga</a> were married, but there are no reports of them tying the knot. The former couple met in 2007 and got engaged soon after they began dating. They were together for 10 years, and have a son David Otunga Jr., who was born in 2009.</p><p>David Otunga worked as a <a href=# rel=noopener>professional wrestler</a> in the WWE. He also has some <a href=# rel=noopener>acting credits</a> under his belt, in projects such as A Madea Family Funeral (2019), The Call (2013), and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022). David is a lawyer as well, who graduated from <a href=# rel=noopener>Harvard Law School in 2006</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The couple separated in 2017 <a href=# rel=noopener>amid accusations of threatening behavior</a> (from Otunga), leading Jennifer to file for a protection order against him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jennifer Hudson’s son?</h2><p>David Daniel Otunga Jr. was born in August 2009, a year after a devastating tragedy hit Jennifer’s family. Her son’s birth came as a relief and a source of joy to the Grammy winner, who lost her mother, brother, and nephew in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>David Jr. (or “DOJ” as his mom likes to call him), turned 13 years old in 2022. <a href=# rel=noopener>In a post shared by Jennifer Hudson</a> (iamjhud is her Instagram handle), she proudly announced to “officially have a teenager” and asked everyone to wish him a happy 13th birthday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>It seems that co-parenting David Jr. is working well for the former couple. The new teenager can be seen on his dad’s profile as well, spending time with his side of the family.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Jennifer Hudson’s mother?</h2><p>Jennifer Hudson was struck with tragedy in 2008 when her mother, brother, and nephew <a href=# rel=noopener>were murdered by William Balfour</a>, her sister Julia’s ex-husband. Jennifer’s mother, Darnell Donerson, was 57 years old when she died. Her brother Jason was 29 and her nephew Julian was 7.&nbsp;</p><p>After their tragic deaths, Jennifer and her sister Julia put up the <a href=# rel=noopener>Julian D. King Foundation</a>, named after Jennifer’s nephew and Julia’s son. The foundation aims to provide support for children from all walks of life in becoming productive and happy adults. They run charitable events every year.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jennifer Hudson dating now?</h2><p>The EGOT winner likes to stay mum about her love life and continues to dodge questions pertaining to it. However, people started speculating when <a href=# rel=noopener>she was spotted getting cozy</a> while on a date with Common at the time they were filming a new movie called Breathe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Jennifer Hudson doing now?</h2><p>The Dreamgirls star has added yet another occupation to her list: talk show host.
