He started earning popularity when he created his YouTube <a rel=nofollow href=#>channel</a> and the series called “Content Cop”. The show highlights other channels, and critiques the YouTubers’ behavior as well as their content.

Some have called his criticisms entertaining, while his episodes have created a significant impact on the content creators who are featured.</p><p>Numerous people have noticed that people under his scrutiny lose a significant number of subscribers, and their ratio of like-to-dislike numbers decreases. Some of the YouTubers featured on his show include RiceGum, Tana Mongeau, and LeafyIsHere, although his first “Content Cop” video was against YouTuber Jinx Reload, in which he criticized his original content as cringeworthy, and that his videos haven’t improved in the many years he’s been on the website.</p><p></p><h2><span id=Controversies_and_Feuds>Controversies and Feuds</span></h2><p>iDubbbz’ next big “Content Cop” release was against DramaAlert’s Keemstar, who has a lot of views on the website.

Keem chose not to respond to this episode but rather called it entertaining. He also apologized for the incidents and comments that have caused others’ problems. However, iDubbbz content started to get on other YouTubers’ nerves, including Tana Mongeau who criticized him on several social media websites.</p><p>In response,&nbsp; iDubbbz appeared in a VIP meet and greet session with Tana, and provoked her resulting in an unfavorable reaction. A few days later, she uploaded a video describing her experience with iDubbbz, while he on the other hand released a new “Content Cop” video exposing how Tana is a hypocrite as she has also used derogatory words in the past, and also <a rel=nofollow href=#>criticized</a> her embellishment of stories and social activity. The video attracted millions of views in the first two days, and prompted an apology from Tana, even though she defended herself by stating that he made some accusations that were out of context.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“WHAT? tHe RoCk Is NoT iN yOuTuB rEwInD!?!” <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/scoGEYSo4m</a></p><p>— Ian.0 (@Idubbbz) <a rel=nofollow href=#>December 6, 2017</a></p><h2><span id=Recent_Projects_and_Music_Releases>Recent Projects and Music Releases</span></h2><p>In 2017, YouTuber RiceGum made a statement in a video that he wanted to have a “Content Cop” video done about him. While many believed that an episode wouldn’t eventuate, iDubbbz eventually released an episode calling RiceGum, Asian Jake Paul.
